      <h1>Léo Ferré, "Avec le temps"</h1>
      <p class="date">May 26, 2025</p>
      <p>I found the Monégasque singer, Léo Ferré, in a roundabout way. I was initially exploring British-Ghanian singer Benjamin Clementine's work: he has a wonderfully theatrical voice, and his song-writing and piano playing is even more theatrical ("Condolence" and "I Won't Complain" are my favorites). He's been rightly lauded in London's musical scene, and he had put together a playlist of his own favorite songs on his Spotify page titled "Bohemian Butterflies." Ferré's song was the only one that Clementine included twice. The double inclusion was probably an accident; nevertheless, the song was clearly on his mind. I was curious as to why. Ferré was, by all accounts, very famous singer in Europe, but he was also before my time, so I did not know until later that the song I was about to listen to, "Avec le temps," was one of his most famous hits when he was alive.</p>

      <p>It did not surprise me to learn that Ferré later sung renditions of some poems from nineteenth-century French decadent poet Charles Baudelaire's <i>Les fleurs du mal / The Flowers of Evil</i> (1857). Baudelaire's signature moodiness surely struck a chord with him. There is an idea in European decadence that all art should aspire to the condition of music—a notion implicit everywhere in French decadence and later made explicit by British decadent philosopher Walter Pater in <i>The Renaissance</i> (1873). But after listening to Ferré's renditions of Baudelaire's poems . . .  well, maybe it's okay for some poems to stay poems and not become music! Pater's diction— <i>aspire</i>, and not <i>become</i>—becomes especially important in this context; that poetry should reach for the condition of music yet ultimately fail to do so seems an important point, and I am not sure if this has been fully explored in scholarship about European decadence yet. Then there is also the fact that the mixed-race Jeanne Duval influenced so much of Baudelaire's poetry, and those delicate traces of her presence in his life and literature seem to vanish when the poems cross transverse the genre and medium and actually <i>become</i> music as opposed to aspiring to it. This is a consistent problem that I've found with Duval, reminding me of Algernon Charles Swinburne in some of my own research. Blackness always seems at risk of erasure when translated through different languages and mediums, and one might wonder if this has to do with its manifestation in the original or the type of translation that was chosen (or both).</p>
